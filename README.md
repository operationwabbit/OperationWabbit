# Operation Wabbit

**A Cognitive Humor Research Project on AI Miscomprehension in Single-Panel Cartoons**

## ðŸš€ Project Overview
Operation Wabbit is an original research initiative designed to uncover and benchmark the narrative and cognitive failure modes of large language models (LLMs) by testing their ability to interpret single-panel cartoons (SPCs). Led by cartoonist and humor theorist Thaddeus Camp, the project uses cartoon-based prompts to stress-test multimodal AI comprehension.
